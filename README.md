**Y**et **A**nother **F**unctional **R**eactive **L**ibrary (**yafrl**) is a small library for _functional reactive programming_ in Kotlin -- meant to provide an alternative
 to constructs from `kotlinx-coroutines` such as `Flow` and `StateFlow`.

For more information, including potential use-cases and some concrete advantages over `Flow`s, see [the docs](https://sintrastes.github.io/yafrl/).
