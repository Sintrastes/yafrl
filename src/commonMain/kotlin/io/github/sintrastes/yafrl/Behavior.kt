/**
 * A behavior is a value of type [A] whose value varies over time.
 *
 * It can be thought of from a denotational perspective as a function
 *  `(Time) -> A`.
 *
 * Visually, you can think of a [Behavior] as a graph where the x-axis
 *  represents time, the y-axis represents different values of [A], and
 *  for each time value there is a different value of [A], for example:
 *
 *  ```
 *  ^
 *  |   *       **
 *  |  * **       *
 *  | *    *   *   *
 *  |       ***      ***
 *  -------------------->
 *  ```
 *
 * [Behavior]s have no other restrictions, and can be either continuous or discrete
 *  functions of time.

    /**
     * Sample a [Behavior] at the occurrences of [times],
     *  returning a new [Event] with the values of the behavior
     *  at those times.
     *
     * Useful for producing a sampled version of a continuous behavior.
     *
     * Example:
     *
     * ```
     * val signal: Behavior<Double> = ...
     *
     * val sampled = signal
     *     .sample(Event.tick(1.second))
     * ```
